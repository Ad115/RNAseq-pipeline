About the project
-----------------
We are trying to detect if there are changes in the expression of
long non-coding RNAs between the left and right hemisphere of a mouse's
brain (telencephalon). For this, 3 samples where taken and sequenced using
RNAseq. For more information about RNAseq, see: 
https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/

The pipeline
------------

The pipeline consists of a series of scripts written for the Xonsh shell (a Python-Bash hybrid,
see xon.sh/ for more information). The scripts are executed in a Sun Grid Engine grid, the job
scheduler of the local cluster. Some scripts are autogenerated according to the kind of data in
order to maximize paralellism and keep the scripts simple. 

The workflow at the moment consists of the next steps:

    - Mapping of the raw reads to the reference (*Mus musculus*) genome using HISAT2.
        The scripts ``script.rnaseq_map.xsh`` and ``script.autogen.rnaseq_map_jobs.xsh``
        are involved in this process. 
    - Conversion of the SAM output to BAM using SAMTools.
        The script ``script.sam_to_bam.xsh`` is involved in this process.

For more documentation on the scripts, look at the scripts themselves.
